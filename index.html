            Bethlehem Ephrathah... out of you will come for me one who will be
            ruler over Israel" (Micah 5:2, NIV). This prophecy was fulfilled in
            Matthew 2:1.

            <strong>The Crucifixion of Jesus:</strong> "They have pierced my
            hands and my feet" (Psalm 22:16, KJV). This prophecy describes the

            abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption"
            (Psalm 16:10, NASB). Fulfilled in Acts 2:31.
          </li>
          <li>

            rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain"

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Spread of the Gospel:</strong> "You will be my witnesses
            in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the

            through global missionary work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promise of Eternal Life:</strong> "For God so loved the

        <h3>Evidence of the Bible’s Reliability:</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-info">
          <li>
            <strong>Historical Accuracy:</strong> Archaeological discoveries,
            such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and the ancient city of Jericho,
            confirm many events, places, and people described in the Bible. (<em
              >Source: "Archaeology and the Bible" by John McRay</em
            >)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Manuscript Evidence:</strong> The Bible has more manuscript
            copies than any other ancient text, with over 5,000 Greek New
            Testament manuscripts, ensuring the text has been accurately
            preserved over time. (<em
              >Source: "The Text of the New Testament" by Bruce M. Metzger and
              Bart D. Ehrman</em
            >)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fulfilled Prophecies:</strong> The Bible contains hundreds
            of prophecies that have been fulfilled, such as the birth of Jesus
            in Bethlehem, His crucifixion, and the fall of Jerusalem. (<em
              >Source: "Evidence That Demands a Verdict" by Josh McDowell</em
            >)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consistency Across Authors:</strong> Despite being written
            by over 40 different authors over 1,500 years, the Bible maintains a
            consistent message of God’s love, redemption, and plan for humanity.
            (<em>Source: "The Case for Christ" by Lee Strobel</em>)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scientific Insights:</strong> While not a science textbook,
            the Bible describes certain scientific principles (like the Earth
            being round) that align with modern discoveries long before they
            were widely known. (<em
              >Source: "The Genesis of Science" by James Hannam</em
            >)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Archaeological Discoveries:</strong> Sites like the Pool of
            Bethesda, King David’s Palace, and the Pilate Stone validate
            biblical accounts and affirm the Bible’s historical credibility.
            (<em>Source: "The Stones Cry Out" by Randall Price</em>)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Impact on Lives:</strong> The transformative power of the
            Bible in individuals' lives across centuries testifies to its
            reliability and divine inspiration. (<em
              >Source: "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis</em
            >)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Textual Integrity:</strong> Rigorous methods of textual
            criticism have demonstrated that the Bible’s text is substantially
            pure and has been transmitted with high accuracy. (<em
              >Source: "The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?" by F.F.
